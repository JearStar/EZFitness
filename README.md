# Easy Fitness

## An app to plan your workouts, and log them

This application will be a fitness app where before a workout session, users will be able to **select** and **queue up**
different exercises, either by a preset list or a custom list. They will be able to view different workouts grouped
by muscle groups (e.g. biceps, triceps, pectorals, etc.) After selecting and queuing up exercises
, they can hit *start* on the queue and as they complete workouts, they will be able to **record** how many sets
, repetitions, weight of the exercise.  At the end of the workout, users can hit "*finished workout*" and the exercises in that **session will be logged and
stored**.
   
This application will be used by **gym-goers** or maybe people who just want a **casual workout**. This is a project of
interest to me because I used to be an active gym-goer before the pandemic and sometimes I would stray off task
from my workout, or I would forget what numbers I benched last week and would spend some more time trying to
find the perfect weight for my 10-rep max. A few reasons this app would be better than a workout log done on paper:
        
- Users don't have to bring around a piece of paper in the gym
- It is faster than having to write things down by handwriting
- Users don't have to additionally bring a pencil around (could be dangerous in a gym)
- Users can use it on their phones which most people bring to listen to music on.
